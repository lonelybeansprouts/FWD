# Factorized Weight Decay(FWD)

This is a keras implementation of facotorize weight decay in convolution layers by overriding 
original covolutional operation with reparameterization trick and a robust initialization method in
recitified neural networks.

This method achieves better classification accuracy rate compared to the traditional weight decay.
